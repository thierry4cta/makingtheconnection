/** 
 * responsive.cascade.css is for styles that will cascade and uses 
 * min-width only media queries. 
 *
 * All the other responsive stylesheets use a stacking method (by 
 * default that is, you can change the media queries in theme settings), 
 * however this uses a waterfall method so we can leverage the cascade 
 * and inheritance for all browsers that support media queries, regardless
 * of screen size.
 *
 * NOTE: this file will NOT load by default, you need to enable it
 * in theme settings under "Global Settings".
 *
 * Usage: you must set the breakpoints manually.
