  #Gpanels

  Gpanels are drop in multi-column snippets for displaying blocks in 
  vertical columns.
 
  How to use a Gpanel:
  1. Copy and paste a Gpanel into your page.tpl.php file.
  2. Copy and paste the region definitions to your themes .info file.
  3. Clear the cache (in Performance settings) to refresh the theme registry. 
  
  Now you can add blocks to the Gpanel regions.
  
  Gpanels are built with percentages and expand to fill their containing
  element, normally a DIV. They will stretch and compress so it does not 
  matter how wide the page is, or what unit you use to set the page width.
  
  Gpanels in Page Templates:
  You can paste a Gpanel almost anywhere in page.tpl.php and it will 
  display correctly. If you embed a Gpanel into an existing region you
  may have to alter the conditional logic for the Gpanel to show up.
  
  Responsive CSS
  The layout CSS for Gpanels (and their kin Panels Layouts) is generated
  by Adaptivetheme and saved to the server in the themeName.responsive.layout.css
  file in your files public directory, find it by going here:

  /files/default/at_css/themeName.responsive.layout.css

  Do not edit this file directly - everytime you save the theme settings
  it gets re-written.
