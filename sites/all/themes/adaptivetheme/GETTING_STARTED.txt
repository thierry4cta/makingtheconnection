# Structure:

  In this directory there are three folders:

  - at_core
  - at_admin
  - at_subtheme

  AT Core - the base theme, includes the pluggable layout system, templates,
  polyfill scripts, forms, very basic CSS used by core and some admin pages and
  a couple CSS files for some theme settings styles, all the core function
  overrides and all the core Extension features available to your sub-themes.

  You can safely ignore this theme, its merely there to run in the background
  and do the heavy lifting. For developers the code is well commented and I have
  tried to structure the theme so its easy to follow. Suggestions, improvements
  and of course patches are welcome.

  AT Admin - administration theme, use is entirely optional.

  AT Subtheme - a blank "starterkit" type theme for building your own sub-theme.
  This is the one you need and will be most interested in if you are developing
  a new theme. Instructions are included in the README in this theme.
